# DARC

## Overview
The DARC is a specialized tool designed to navigate and index content on the dark web. It operates over the Tor network to ensure anonymity and security, collecting data for analysis, research, or monitoring purposes. This crawler is built to handle the unique complexities and potential risks associated with the dark web environment.
