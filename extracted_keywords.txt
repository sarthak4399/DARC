Get connected

If you are in a country where Tor is blocked, you can configure Tor to connect to a bridge during the setup process. 


If Tor is not censored, one of the most common reasons Tor won't connect is an incorrect system clock. Please make sure it's set correctly.

Stay safe

Please do not torrent over Tor. 
           Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address.


We do not recommend installing additional add-ons or plugins into Tor Browser
Plugins or addons may bypass Tor or compromise your privacy. Tor Browser already comes with HTTPS-Only mode, NoScript, and other patches to protect your privacy and security.











Check out the 
Tor Browser manual
 for more troubleshooting tips.
